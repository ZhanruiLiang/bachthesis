Guitarist, the application, is written in the Python 3 language. The rendering engine is powered by OpenGL and sound playing is powered by the midi module in Pygame.

The whole application is splited into three projects, namely: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item raygllib
    \item pysheetmusic
    \item guitarist
\end{itemize}.

And here's the third party library dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PyOpenGL
    \item Pyglet
    \item Pygame
    \item Numpy
    \item Cython
\end{itemize}

For now, the application has been tested on Linux only.
To install, use \verb|pip install| or \verb|easy_install| to install the third party dependencies. Then, install \verb|raygllib| and \verb|pysheetmusic|, which are normal python packages.

To run the application, just run the \verb|main.py| in project \verb|guitarist| as python script.
